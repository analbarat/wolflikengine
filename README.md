# wolflikeengine

simple wolf3d-like engine using only SDL2 and basic c++

no textures (yet), no gui, just the pure wall&sky&ceiling renderer and user control


# the game is undergoing redesign at the moment.

you can view a minimalist version of it under the "rewrite" branch (it was writed on debian, so it will work on linux)

meanwhile i want to fully rewrite the master branch, add sprites, textures etc
it will be a VC++ 2017 project
