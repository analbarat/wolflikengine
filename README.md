# wolflikeengine

simple wolf3d-like engine using only SDL2 and basic c++

no textures (yet), no gui, just the pure wall&sky&ceiling renderer and user control

# usage
game controls: 

              delete: strafe left

              pgdown: strafe right

              arrow keys: move

map editor controls:

                    arrow keys: move selection

                    q: delete block

                    d: door block

                    e: door entry block (from where you can open the door)

                    w: wall block

                    1: open "map1.dat" file

                    2: save to "map1.dat" file


# the game is undergoing redesign at the moment.

you can view a minimalist version of it under the "rewrite" branch (it was writed on debian, so it will work on linux)

meanwhile i want to fully rewrite the master branch, add sprites, textures etc
